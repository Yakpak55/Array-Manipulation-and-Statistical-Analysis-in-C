# Array-Manipulation-and-Statistical-Analysis-in-C
In this project, I implemented a program that performs various operations on an array of random integers. The operations include calculating statistical measures, sorting the array, shifting elements, and reversing the array.

Here's a breakdown of the tasks performed:

● Generate Array: Initializes an array with random integers.

● Mean, Min, Max Calculation: Computes the mean, minimum, and maximum values of the array.

● Sorting: Sorts the array in ascending order using a simple sorting algorithm.

● Double Shift: Shifts the array elements to the right by two positions.

● Reversal: Reverses the entire array.

Each of these tasks was implemented as a separate function, ensuring modularity and clarity in the code.
